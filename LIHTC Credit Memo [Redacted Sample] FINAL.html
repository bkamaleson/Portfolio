The development will provide [Redacted Number] rent- and income-restricted units, with [Redacted Number] units at 30% AMI, [Redacted Number] units at 50% AMI, and [Redacted Number] units at 60% AMI, resulting in a blended AMI restriction of [Redacted Percentage]. The complex will feature various amenities, including a single-story clubhouse, secured entry gates, a pavilion with BBQ and picnic areas for events, and carports. The clubhouse will house a business center, kitchen, leasing offices, fitness center, and restrooms.</p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-8193-a64e-e00ce7ae888d" class="">[Redacted Company] (&quot;[Redacted Company]&quot;), is 100% owned by [Redacted Name], will serve as the developer for this project.

[Redacted Name], established [Redacted Company] in [Redacted Year] and has extensive expertise in finance, development, construction, and asset management of both affordable and market-rate rental housing (bio detailed in Appendix [Redacted]). Between [Redacted Company] and [Redacted Company], [Redacted Name] has been responsible for construction and management of over [Redacted Number] multifamily units with aggregate costs exceed [Redacted Amount].</p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81f1-b42a-d5343f514c04" class="">The total project cost is estimated at [Redacted Amount], with [Redacted Amount] in hard costs, [Redacted Amount] of soft costs, and [Redacted Amount] toward the prepaid ground lease. Permanent financing is projected at [Redacted Amount]. The project has been allocated a total of [Redacted Amount] in Federal LIHTC. [Redacted Company] is providing LIHTC Equity of [Redacted Amount] at a price of [Redacted Amount]. The equity contributions from [Redacted Company] will be disbursed at four milestones: [Redacted Amount] at the closing of the construction financing, [Redacted Amount] at construction completion, [Redacted Amount] at property stabilization, and [Redacted Amount] upon receipt of 8609&#x27;s.</p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81de-abb7-eb36bba3bb57" class="">[Redacted Company] (&quot;[Redacted Company]&quot;) has already closed the loan in [Redacted Month] and is willing to sell us a portion of the loan. [Redacted Company] is working to secure a syndication partner prior to committing to [Redacted Company]. Most of the analysis is based on [Redacted Company] credit underwriting prior to loan closing. Since the loan is already closed, [Redacted Company] does not have the ability to materially change the loan terms.</p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81e1-a1db-c7f74f452d19" class="">As background, [Redacted Company] has financed over [Redacted Amount] in LIHTC deals, although this is their first transaction with this particular developer.

Any participation would also be subject availability of long-term funds.

On a per-unit basis, this equates to initial gross revenue of [Redacted Amount] per unit, increasing to [Redacted Amount] per unit over the same period. The revenue stream includes a small portion from other income sources, beginning at [Redacted Amount] annually and rising to [Redacted Amount] by Year 15.

Notably, the market study estimates a lower vacancy rate of [Redacted Percentage] for market-rate units, which reflects a more optimistic scenario.</p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-816d-97ef-ec06b4dbd676" class="">Operating Expenses: Operating expenses are projected to be [Redacted Amount] in Year 1, which represents [Redacted Percentage] of the gross rental income. These expenses are expected to escalate by [Redacted Percentage] annually, reaching [Redacted Amount] by Year 15. On a per-unit basis, this equates to [Redacted Amount] annually or [Redacted Amount] per month. This is slightly below expectations, as the appraisal&#x27;s set of comparables reports an average OPEX per-unit of [Redacted Amount] annually, or [Redacted Amount] per month, primarily explained by difference in amenities (i.e. pool maintenance), differing maintenance costs, and management compensation variances. The financial model also includes a replacement reserve budgeted at [Redacted Percentage] of gross rental income, amounting to [Redacted Amount] in Year 1, or [Redacted Amount] per unit. Additionally, a management fee of [Redacted Percentage] of gross rental income is factored in, totaling [Redacted Amount] in Year 1. This management fee is on the lower end of the typical [Redacted Percentage] to [Redacted Percentage] range, and on the lower end of comparable properties, but remains within industry standards.</p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-8118-9140-fdcc841d3367" class="">Debt Service and Coverage: The debt service for the permanent loan is projected at [Redacted Amount] per year, based on a [Redacted Percentage] interest rate and a [Redacted Time Period] amortization period. This results in a stabilized Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) of [Redacted Ratio]. The global DSCR, which includes debt service for both the permanent and a subsidized refinancing loan, starts at [Redacted Ratio] in Year 1 and improves to [Redacted Ratio] by Year 15. When considering only the permanent loan, the DSCR (referred to as the &quot;Legacy DSCR&quot;) begins at [Redacted Ratio] in Year 1 and increases to [Redacted Ratio] by Year 15.</p><h1 id="11cb7e8c-1da9-8137-849b-fb70ddcf2a9f" class="">APPENDIX D – RENT STRUCTURE</h1><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81f7-8bea-c310df489582" class="">[Table redacted]</p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81f7-8c7e-c535419aba27" class="">The property is expected to attain stabilization [Redacted Time Period] after the completion of construction.

Out of the total [Redacted Number] units, [Redacted Number] are [Redacted Unit Type] units, while the remaining [Redacted Number] are [Redacted Unit Type] units. The units range in size from an average of [Redacted Size] square feet to [Redacted Size] square feet, with a total net rental square footage of [Redacted Size] square feet.</p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81ad-a102-f095e5860ff4" class="">The rent structure of the property incorporates Area Median Income (AMI) restrictions.

According to the [Redacted Company] Market study, average market rents are [Redacted Amount]. An analysis of the rent structure reveals that the average weighted savings, proportionate to units per AMI class, is estimated at [Redacted Amount] per unit per month.

This scenario is mitigated by the pricing structure of the permanent loan, which is set at [Redacted Financial Index] plus [Redacted Basis Points]. However, since the permanent loan has closed and the rate is locked at [Redacted Percentage], there is very little risk to interest rates driving negative cash flow.</p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-8148-a1d7-ff9cfe45f97b" class="">In the maximum vacancy rate scenario, a [Redacted Percentage] vacancy rate, representing a [Redacted Percentage] point increase, would be necessary to achieve a [Redacted Financial Ratio] DSCR. This scenario is mitigated by current market trends in the project area. The market analysis reports vacancy rates ranging from [Redacted Percentage] to [Redacted Percentage] among [Redacted Number] comparable properties, indicating that the initial [Redacted Percentage] vacancy rate assumption was already conservative for this market.</p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81d2-b027-c95b3078c979" class="">For the maximum OPEX % scenario, achieving a [Redacted Financial Ratio] DSCR would require OPEX to be [Redacted Percentage] of GRI, representing a [Redacted Percentage] increase.
