These estimates are derived from current encounter/patient ratios from other Sponsor-operated sites and historical visit utilizations. To assess the economics and productivity, the borrower refers to historical data of start-ups and existing sites with similar service lines and patient demographics. The total income is projected to steadily increase from [Redacted Dollar Amount] in [Redacted Year] to [Redacted Dollar Amount] in [Redacted Year], with an average annual growth rate of [Redacted Percentage]. The total expenses also increase over the [Redacted Number]-year period, reaching [Redacted Dollar Amount] in [Redacted Year], with an average annual increase of [Redacted Percentage]. Despite increasing expenses, net income remains consistently positive, ranging from [Redacted Dollar Amount] in [Redacted Year] to [Redacted Dollar Amount] in [Redacted Year]. The Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is strong, starting at [Redacted Number]x in [Redacted Year], falling to [Redacted Number]X as the [Redacted Company Name] clinic operations ramp up, and climbing to [Redacted Number]x in [Redacted Year]. Additionally, there is a surplus after debt service, ranging from [Redacted Dollar Amount] in [Redacted Year] to [Redacted Dollar Amount] in [Redacted Year]. Overall, these projections demonstrate a positive financial outlook for [Redacted Company Name], and very low credit risk for [Redacted Company Name].</p><h2 id="11cb7e8c-1da9-8125-9946-ca1179e2f6d6" class="">TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81b0-9cb7-fc771c0a6607" class=""><a href="about:blank#a-diagram-of-a-house-description-automatically-generatedappendix-a-nmtc-structure">APPENDIX A – NMTC STRUCTURE 15</a></p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-8159-9599-c391f83c50e1" class=""><a href="about:blank#appendix-b-qalicb-financial-projections-5-years-operating-cash-flow">APPENDIX B –QALICB FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS – 5 YEARS OPERATING CASH FLOW 18</a></p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81a1-a869-f10a1a465d47" class=""><a href="about:blank#appendix-c-financial-projection-of-borrower-operations">APPENDIX C – FINANCIAL PROJECTION OF BORROWER OPERATIONS 19</a></p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81da-bbb6-f9ea462d7841" class=""><a href="about:blank#appendix-d-scenario-analysis-tables">APPENDIX D – SCENARIO ANALYSIS TABLES 21</a></p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81c8-8522-ee8b5eb16c66" class=""><a href="about:blank#appendix-e-management-board-biographies">APPENDIX E – MANAGEMENT &amp; BOARD BIOGRAPHIES 22</a></p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-810e-94e1-ca484fdff45e" class=""><a href="about:blank#appendix-f-appraisal-summary">APPENDIX F – APPRAISAL SUMMARY 27</a></p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-81f8-b5a1-dae8736ab512" class=""><a href="about:blank#appendix-g-city-first-key-financial-metrics">APPENDIX G –CITY FIRST– KEY FINANCIAL METRICS 29</a></p><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-811e-9e86-d78c0306f483" class=""><a href="about:blank#appendix-h-credit-risk-rating-grid">APPENDIX H –CREDIT RISK RATING GRID 32</a></p><h1 id="11cb7e8c-1da9-8142-aca8-daf5a85934be" class="">APPENDIX A – NMTC STRUCTURE</h1><p id="11cb7e8c-1da9-805e-9944-d154d966c0ac" class="">[Redacted graphic]</p><ol type="1" id="11cb7e8c-1da9-8172-a703-c62cb45b4263" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Total project cost is [Redacted Dollar Amount].
